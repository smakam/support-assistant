# LangSmith Debugging: Vector Search Issue

## Issue Identified through LangSmith

LangSmith traces revealed an issue in the StaticKnowledgeAgent where vector search was being called but not properly utilized. Despite initializing a vector database and retrieving relevant documents, the entire knowledge base was being passed as context to the LLM, resulting in answers based on the full knowledge base rather than just the relevant portions.

## Root Cause Analysis

After detailed investigation, we identified three key issues:

1. **Chunking Strategy**: The knowledge base was being split into chunks that were too large. For a bullet-point style knowledge base with only 13 items, this ineffective chunking meant most of the knowledge base was included in a single chunk.

2. **Retriever Configuration**: The retriever wasn't properly limiting the number of results, and the similarity search was retrieving too many chunks.

3. **Prompt Effectiveness**: The prompt wasn't strongly instructing the LLM to strictly use only the provided context.

## Final Solution

We implemented a comprehensive solution:

1. **Precise Chunking Strategy**:

   - Changed to store each bullet point as its own individual document
   - This ensures precise retrieval of only the relevant bullet points
   - Eliminated all chunk overlap to prevent duplication of content

2. **Stricter Retriever Configuration**:

   - Explicitly configured the retriever with `search_type="similarity"`
   - Reduced `k` from 5 to 2 to retrieve only the most relevant bullet points
   - This ensures minimal, focused context is provided to the LLM

3. **Enhanced Prompt Engineering**:

   - Added stronger directives like "IMPORTANT: Your answer must be based ONLY on the retrieved context"
   - Added explicit instructions to acknowledge information gaps
   - Added formatting to make instructions more prominent

4. **Improved Logging and Observability**:
   - Added detailed logging of each bullet point and retrieval results
   - Logged which documents were actually used in the chain's response
   - Enabled verbose mode for full traceability in LangSmith

## Verification with LangSmith

After implementing these changes, LangSmith traces now show:

1. Each bullet point is properly indexed as a separate document
2. Only 2 most relevant bullet points are retrieved for any query
3. The LLM response is strictly limited to the information in those bullet points
4. The entire retrieval-to-response flow is fully observable

## Implementation Details

The key changes were made in `app/services/agents/static_agent.py`:

```python
# Process one bullet point at a time for precise retrieval
lines = raw_text.split('\n')
texts = []

for line in lines:
    if line.strip().startswith('- '):
        texts.append(line.strip())

# Configure retriever for better performance
retriever = self.vector_store.as_retriever(
    search_type="similarity",
    search_kwargs={"k": 2}  # Limit to top 2 most relevant chunks only
)

# Add stronger directives in the prompt
qa_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    ("system", f"""...
    IMPORTANT: Your answer must be based ONLY on the retrieved context provided below.
    ..."""),
    ("human", "Question: {question}\nContext:\n{context}")
])
```

These changes ensure that when you analyze static queries in LangSmith, you can now see that the vector database is properly utilized, with only the relevant documents being used to generate the response.
